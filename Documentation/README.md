## Design Decisions

- Functionality was focused on serializing and **signing transactions locally** on the device to **send raw transactions** to the Ethereum network
- **Requirements for password input** on every transaction are indeed a design decision. Interface designers can save user passwords with the user's consent
- Public function for **private key export** is exposed for user convenience but marked as `UNSAFE_`. Typical workflow takes care of EIP155 compatibility and proper clearing of private key data from memory

## FAQ

> Is it possible to get a Mnemonic Phrase (Seed Phrase) from Private key using web3swift?

In web3swift, there is no backward conversion from the Private key to Mnemonic Phrase. Also, it is theoretically impossible to recover a phrase from a Private key. After Seed Phrase is converted to some initial entropy, the "master key is derived," and the **initial entropy is discarded**.

The simplest solution is to encrypt the phrase using the user's pin code and save it in some other secure keystore.
The mnemonic phrase is very sensitive data, and you must be very careful to let the user get it.
Our advice if you want to show it to a user - ask to save a Passphrase when creating BIP32Keystore.

> How to interact with custom smart-contract with web3swift?

For example: you want to interact with smart-contract and all you know is - its address (address example: 0xfa28eC7198028438514b49a3CF353BcA5541ce1d).

You can get the ABI of your contract directly from [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) ([Solution](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/27536/where-to-find-contract-abi-in-new-version-of-online-remix-solidity-compiler?rq=1))

Then you should use contract address and ABI in creating contract object. In example we use Infura Mainnet:

```swift
let yourContractABI: String = <CONTRACT JSON ABI>
let toEthereumAddress: EthereumAddress = <DESTINATION ETHEREUM ADDRESS>
let abiVersion: Int = <ABI VERSION NUMBER>

let contract = Web3.InfuraMainnetWeb3().contract(yourContractABI, at: toEthereumAddress, abiVersion: abiVersion)
```

Here is the example how you should call contract method:

```swift
let method: String = <CONTRACT METHOD NAME>
let parameters: [AnyObject] = <PARAMETERS>
let extraData: Data = <DATA>
let transactionOptions: TransactionOptions = <OPTIONS>

let transaction = contract.read(method, parameters: parameters, extraData: extraData, transactionOptions: transactionOptions)
```

Here is the example how you should send transaction to some contract method:

```swift
let method: String = <CONTRACT METHOD NAME>
let parameters: [AnyObject] = <PARAMETERS>
let extraData: Data = <DATA>
let transactionOptions: TransactionOptions = <OPTIONS>
let transaction = contract.write(method, parameters: parameters, extraData: extraData, transactionOptions: transactionOptions)
```

> How to test on a local node?

```swift
func setLocalNode(port: Int = 8545) -> Web3? {
    guard let web3 = Web3(url: URL(string: "http://127.0.0.1:\(port)")!) else { return nil }
    return web3
}
```
